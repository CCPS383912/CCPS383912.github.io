    <h1>About Me></h1>
    <P> Through out my life I've always enjoyed playing sports especially soccer. I have always been surrounded by people who have felt the same way as I have. I want to be able to achieve this goal while also being around the people who have helped me get here. 
For the time being I have been practicing daily and multiple hours a day. I play with and against my friends to help better improve my skills and reflexes. Finding a team to play with has been a struggle but I'll keep searching. 
 The values that are most valuable to me for my success is being able to work as a team but also being able to rely on myself. Teamwork is essential for my goal and I need to be able to adapt and fit in with the team. There will also be times where I can't rely on my team and ill just have work it out on my own.
 My short-term goal is to be able to join some sort of team whether it be the school or at a club. That'll help me both with my confidence and get me one step closer to my goal.The achievements and traits I want to be most known for is having the strongest desire to win the game. I want to be known as the one who lead their to to victory. Having lead your team to victory who help you become more confident in yourself.</P>
